# Microservice POC

This repository serves as a proof of concept (PoC) for microservices using multiple frameworks, including Express.js, Elysia.js, GoFiber, and FastAPI. It demonstrates key aspects of microservice architecture by integrating Kafka for producer and consumer messaging, and gRPC for communication between services in a serverless pattern. The PoC highlights the strengths and use cases of each framework in a microservices environment, providing a comparative analysis of their performance and scalability.

## TODO
- [x] Basic ExpressJS
- [ ] Basic ElysiaJS
- [ ] Basic GoFiber
- [ ] Basic FastAPI
- [ ] gRPC for secure communication
- [ ] Integrate together
